# Feature Specification: Computer Vision Model Evaluation Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to develop a web app to evaluate different Object Detection (ObjDet) and Segmentation (Seg) models. (Like Yolo, SAM2, mmdetection, rt-detr, etc...) It should be possible to upload images to the server before any kind of processing and view them in the app. Images should be organized in train/val/test folders in the app. It should be possible to annotate images using a pre-trained model like SAM2. This will be later used to either train/fine-tune a model or used as visual prompt for model supporting this. Annotations should be saved in a database with a user tag. It should be possible to run inference of ObjDet or Seg models on images. Generated annotations should be saved in a database with a model tag. It should be possible to see the annotations produced by the inference, which should appear in a different color than annotations done by human in the training phase. It should be possible to evaluate performance in terms of time execution and accuracy from the predictions. It should be possible to select which model to be used for annotations and inferences. Once some user annotations are available, it should be possible to train/fine-tune a model. When launching the train/fine-tune of a model, it should be possible to monitor the execution of the pipeline in the app. When a fine-tuned model has been trained, it should be possible to run inference on a batch of images and monitor the execution of the pipeline in the app."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A computer vision researcher wants to evaluate and compare different object detection and segmentation models on their custom dataset. They need to upload images, organize them into training datasets, annotate images either manually or with pre-trained models, run inference with various models, compare performance metrics, and fine-tune models based on their annotations. Additionally, they require experiment tracking to compare model versions, active learning to optimize annotation efforts, and the ability to deploy successful models as APIs. The entire workflow should be manageable through a web interface with real-time monitoring of long-running processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no images in the system, **When** user uploads 100 images via web interface, **Then** images are stored and organized into train/val/test folders as specified by user
2. **Given** uploaded images in train folder, **When** user selects SAM2 model and does some annotations, **Then** system saves them with model tag, displaying them in distinct color
3. **Given** user-created annotations exist, **When** user initiates model fine-tuning, **Then** fine-tuning pipeline starts and progress is visible in real-time monitoring interface
4. **Given** a fine-tuned model is available, **When** user runs batch inference on test images, **Then** system processes all images, saves results with model tag, and displays performance metrics
5. **Given** multiple annotation sets exist, **When** user compares model predictions vs ground truth, **Then** system displays accuracy metrics and execution time comparisons
6. **Given** multiple model experiments have been run, **When** user accesses experiment tracking dashboard, **Then** system displays model versions, hyperparameters, and performance comparisons in a sortable table
7. **Given** a fine-tuned model with uncertain predictions exists, **When** user initiates active learning, **Then** system identifies and prioritizes the most informative images for human annotation
8. **Given** a successfully fine-tuned model, **When** user requests deployment, **Then** system generates REST API endpoints and provides deployment configuration

### Edge Cases

- What happens when uploaded image format is unsupported or corrupted?
=> It should be possible to display a message to the user indicating that the image format is unsupported or corrupted.
- How does system handle fine-tuning pipeline failures or interruptions?
=> It should be possible to display a message to the user indicating that the fine-tuning pipeline has failed or been interrupted.
- What occurs when multiple users attempt to fine-tune models simultaneously?
=> In our case, we will not allow multiple users to fine-tune models simultaneously.
- How does system behave when storage space is exhausted?
=> It should be possible to display a message to the user indicating that the storage space is exhausted.
- What happens when model deployment to API endpoints fails?
=> It should be possible to display deployment failure details and allow retry with different configuration.
- How does system handle API endpoint authentication issues during deployment?
=> It should be possible to display authentication errors and provide guidance for configuring deployment credentials.
- What occurs when large images cause memory overflow during processing?
=> It should be possible to automatically resize or tile large images and notify user of processing limitations.
