# Feature Specification: Object Detection and Segmentation Model Evaluation Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-oob-evaluation-claude`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# oob-evaluation-claude spec

I would like to develop a web app to evaluate different Object Detection (ObjDet) and Segmentation (Seg) models. (Like Yolo, SAM2, mmdetection, rt-detr, etc...)

It should be possible to upload images to the server before any kind of processing and view them in the app.
Images should be organized in train/val/test folders in the app.
It should be possible to annotate images using a pre-trained model like SAM2. This will be later used to either train/fine-tune a model or used as visual prompt for model supporting this. Annotations should be saved in a database with a user tag.
It should be possible to run inference of ObjDet or Seg models on images. Generated annotations should be saved in a database with a model tag.
It should be possible to see the annotations produced by the inference, which should appear in a different color than annotations done by human in the training phase.
It should be possible to evaluate performance in terms of time execution and accuracy from the predictions.
It should be possible to select which model to be used for annotations and inferences.
Once some user annotations are available, it should be possible to train/fine-tune a model.
When launching the train/fine-tune of a model, it should be possible to monitor the execution of the pipeline in the app.
When a fine-tuned model has been trained, it should be possible to run inference on a batch of images and monitor the execution of the pipeline in the app."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a computer vision researcher or ML engineer, I want to evaluate and compare different object detection and segmentation models on my custom datasets, so that I can determine which models perform best for my specific use case and create improved models through fine-tuning.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a set of images, **When** I upload them to the system, **Then** they are organized in train/val/test folders and I can view them in the web interface
2. **Given** uploaded images, **When** I select a pre-trained model like SAM2 for annotation, **Then** I can generate annotations that are saved with user tags for training purposes
3. **Given** images with annotations, **When** I run inference with different object detection or segmentation models, **Then** model predictions are saved with model tags and displayed in different colors from user annotations
4. **Given** model predictions on test data, **When** I request performance evaluation, **Then** I see execution time and accuracy metrics for each model
5. **Given** sufficient user annotations, **When** I initiate model training/fine-tuning, **Then** I can monitor the training pipeline execution in real-time
6. **Given** a trained model, **When** I run batch inference on multiple images, **Then** I can monitor the inference pipeline execution and view results
7. **Given** a trained and validated model, **When** I deploy it as an API endpoint, **Then** I can serve predictions to external applications in real-time

### Edge Cases

- What happens when uploaded images are in unsupported formats?
-> report an error
- How does the system handle extremely large image files that might cause memory issues?
-> report an error
- What occurs when model training fails or is interrupted?
-> report an error
- How are conflicts handled when multiple users annotate the same image?
-> report an error
