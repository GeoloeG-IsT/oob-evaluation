# Implementation Plan: Object Detection and Segmentation Model Evaluation Web App

**Branch**: `001-oob-evaluation-claude` | **Date**: 2025-09-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/pascal/wks/oob-evaluation-claude/specs/001-oob-evaluation-claude/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - frontend/ and backend/ structure based on Next.js/FastAPI stack

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- **Reference**: `task-mapping.md` provides detailed cross-references between design docs and implementation tasks
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs with explicit file path mappings:
  - Each contract endpoint → contract test task [P] (15 endpoints mapped in task-mapping.md)
  - Each entity → model creation task [P] (8 entities with specific file paths)
  - Each user story → integration test task (8 quickstart workflows)
  - Technology setup tasks for Next.js/FastAPI/PostgreSQL/Celery stack
  - ML integration tasks for YOLO11/12, RT-DETR, SAM2 frameworks
  - Library creation tasks (ml-models, inference-engine, training-pipeline, annotation-tools)
  - CLI implementation tasks for each library with constitutional compliance

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Database/Models → API Services → Libraries → UI Components
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Group related tasks for efficient development

**Estimated Output**: 50-60 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:

- **Setup Phase**: 8 technology-specific initialization tasks
- **Contract Tests**: 15 endpoint test tasks [P] (mapped to api-spec.yaml)
- **Data Models**: 8 entity creation tasks [P] (mapped to data-model.md)
- **Integration Tests**: 8 workflow test tasks (mapped to quickstart.md)
- **ML Integration**: 12 computer vision framework tasks
- **API Implementation**: 15 endpoint implementation tasks
- **Service Layer**: 8 business logic service tasks
- **Libraries**: 4 feature library creation tasks [P]
- **CLI Commands**: 4 command-line interface tasks [P]
- **Frontend Components**: 7 React component tasks
- **Docker/Deployment**: 5 containerization and deployment tasks

**Reference Documentation**:

- `task-mapping.md`: Complete cross-reference between tasks and design documents
- `contracts/api-spec.yaml`: API endpoint specifications with operation IDs
- `data-model.md`: Entity definitions with field specifications
- `quickstart.md`: Validation workflows with expected outcomes

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
