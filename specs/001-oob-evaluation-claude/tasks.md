# Tasks: Object Detection and Segmentation Model Evaluation Web App

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/pascal/wks/oob-evaluation-claude/specs/001-oob-evaluation-claude/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Next.js/React/TypeScript (frontend), FastAPI/Python (backend), PostgreSQL, Celery
   → Structure: Web application with frontend/ and backend/ directories
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 8 entities (Image, Annotation, Model, Dataset, TrainingJob, InferenceJob, PerformanceMetric, Deployment)
   → contracts/api-spec.yaml: 20 operations across 8 endpoint groups
   → quickstart.md: 8 validation workflows
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, Docker configuration
   → Tests: 20 contract tests, 8 integration tests
   → Core: 8 models, 8 services, 20 endpoints, 4 ML libraries
   → Integration: DB, Celery workers, frontend components
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, deployment
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Total: 82 numbered tasks (T001-T082)
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path

- Setup (T001-T008) before everything
- Contract tests (T009-T028) before implementation (T037+)
- Integration tests (T029-T036) before implementation (T037+)
- Models (T037-T044) before services (T053-T060)
- Libraries (T045-T048) before services (T053-T060)
- Services (T053-T060) before endpoints (T061-T068)
- Core implementation before workers (T069-T072)
- Backend services before frontend components (T076-T080)

### Blocking Dependencies

- T037-T044 (models) block T053-T060 (services)
- T045-T048 (ML libraries) block T053-T060 (services)
- T053-T060 (services) block T061-T068 (endpoints)
- T061-T068 (endpoints) block T076-T080 (frontend)
- T069-T072 (workers) require T053-T060 (services)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 1: Setup (All Parallel)

```bash
# Launch T001-T008 together after T001 creates structure:
Task: "Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript in frontend/"
Task: "Initialize FastAPI project with Poetry in backend/"
Task: "Initialize Celery project structure in celery/"
Task: "Configure ESLint and Prettier for frontend in frontend/.eslintrc.js"
Task: "Configure pytest and Black for backend in backend/pyproject.toml"
Task: "Setup Docker configurations in docker/Dockerfile.frontend, docker/Dockerfile.backend, docker/Dockerfile.celery"
Task: "Create docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml in repository root"
```

### Phase 2: Contract Tests (All Parallel)

```bash
# Launch T009-T028 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/v1/images (uploadImages) in backend/tests/contract/test_images_upload.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/images (listImages) in backend/tests/contract/test_images_list.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/images/{id} (getImage) in backend/tests/contract/test_images_get.py"
# ... (all 20 contract tests)
```

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (All Parallel)

```bash
# Launch T029-T036 together:
Task: "Integration test image upload workflow in backend/tests/integration/test_image_upload_workflow.py"
Task: "Integration test manual annotation workflow in backend/tests/integration/test_manual_annotation_workflow.py"
# ... (all 8 integration tests)
```

### Phase 4: Models and Libraries (All Parallel)

```bash
# Launch T037-T052 together:
Task: "Image model and migration in backend/src/models/image.py and backend/migrations/001_create_images_table.sql"
Task: "ML models library with YOLO11/12 integration in backend/src/lib/ml_models/"
Task: "ML models CLI commands in backend/src/cli/ml_models_cli.py"
# ... (all models, libraries, and CLI commands)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow TDD: RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal implementation) → REFACTOR
- All ML models must support variants specified in research.md
- Frontend components must integrate with real-time WebSocket updates
- Database migrations must include proper indexes and constraints
- Celery workers must include progress tracking and error handling

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: Each of 20 operations → contract test task [P]
2. **From Data Model**: Each of 8 entities → model creation task [P]
3. **From User Stories**: Each of 8 quickstart workflows → integration test [P]
4. **From Architecture**: Libraries with CLI commands → separate tasks [P]
5. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Polish

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 20 API operations have corresponding contract tests
- [x] All 8 entities have model creation tasks
- [x] All 8 quickstart workflows have integration tests
