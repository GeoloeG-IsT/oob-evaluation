# ML Evaluation Platform Implementation: Best Practices Research

## Executive Summary

This research provides comprehensive best practices for implementing an ML evaluation platform using FastAPI + Python, Next.js + React + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker + Docker Compose, and modern computer vision models (YOLO11/12, RT-DETR, SAM2). The findings focus on real-time inference, large file handling, async training pipelines, model versioning, and computer vision annotation workflows.

## 1. FastAPI + Python for ML Model Inference and Training APIs

### Decision
FastAPI with Python 3.11+ for backend ML APIs

### Rationale
- **Performance**: FastAPI has matured into the preferred framework for ML model serving, replacing many Flask+gunicorn implementations
- **Async Support**: Native async/await support enables efficient handling of I/O-bound ML operations
- **Automatic Documentation**: Built-in Swagger UI generation reduces development overhead
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic integration provides robust request/response validation

### Alternatives Considered
- **Flask + Gunicorn**: Less performant, lacks native async support
- **Django + DRF**: Overhead unnecessary for ML APIs
- **Ray Serve**: Better for complex multi-model deployments but higher complexity

## 2. Next.js + React + TypeScript for Interactive ML Evaluation Frontend

### Decision
Next.js 14+ with React 18 and TypeScript for frontend

### Rationale
- **TypeScript Integration**: Built-in TypeScript support with incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering (SSR) improves initial load times for ML evaluation interfaces
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and development environment
- **ML Framework Support**: Strong ecosystem for integrating ONNX Runtime, TensorFlow.js

### Alternatives Considered
- **React SPA**: Lacks SSR benefits for SEO and initial load performance
- **Vue.js**: Smaller ecosystem for ML libraries
- **Svelte**: Less mature ecosystem for enterprise ML applications

## 3. PostgreSQL for Storing Annotations, Model Metadata, and Results

### Decision
PostgreSQL 15+ and pgvector extension

### Rationale
- **Vector Database Support**: Native pgvector integration for embedding storage and similarity search
- **Real-time Features**: Built-in real-time subscriptions for collaborative annotation
- **Metadata Storage**: JSONB support for flexible model metadata storage
- **ML Integration**: Edge Functions with built-in AI model APIs

### Alternatives Considered
- **MongoDB**: Less SQL compatibility, weaker consistency guarantees
- **AWS RDS**: Higher operational overhead, no built-in vector support
- **Firebase**: Limited query capabilities, vendor lock-in concerns

## 4. Celery for Asynchronous Model Training and Batch Inference Tasks

### Decision
Celery 5+ with Redis as broker and result backend

### Rationale
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Well-established with extensive documentation and community support
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports multiple brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis) and result backends
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple machines and auto-scaling capabilities
- **ML Integration**: Good support for long-running ML training jobs

### Alternatives Considered
- **Ray**: Better for complex distributed ML but higher learning curve
- **Dask**: Good for data processing but less mature for general task queuing
- **AWS SQS/Lambda**: Serverless but limited execution time and GPU support

## 5. Docker + Docker Compose for Containerizing ML Models and Services

### Decision
Docker with multi-stage builds and Docker Compose for orchestration

### Rationale
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with orchestration platforms
- **Isolation**: Prevents dependency conflicts between different models
- **Portability**: Deploy consistently across different cloud providers

### Alternatives Considered
- **Kubernetes**: More complex but better for large-scale deployments
- **Podman**: Good Docker alternative but less ecosystem support
- **Singularity**: Better for HPC environments but limited general use

## 6. YOLO11/12, RT-DETR, SAM2 Integration Patterns for Computer Vision Models

### Decision
Unified integration using Ultralytics framework for YOLO models, standalone RT-DETR, and Meta's SAM2

### Rationale
- **YOLO11/12**: State-of-the-art real-time object detection with attention mechanisms
- **RT-DETR**: Vision Transformer-based detector with efficient hybrid encoder
- **SAM2**: Next-generation segmentation for videos and images
- **Ecosystem**: Ultralytics provides unified API and deployment tools

### Model Selection Strategy
- **YOLO11**: General-purpose real-time detection
- **YOLO12**: When maximum accuracy is required (+2.1% mAP over YOLOv10)
- **RT-DETR**: Complex scenes requiring Transformer-based attention
- **SAM2**: Precise segmentation and video object tracking

### Alternatives Considered
- **YOLOv8/v10**: Older architectures with lower accuracy
- **Detectron2**: More complex setup and deployment
- **MMDetection**: Research-focused, less production-ready

## Key Technical Patterns

### Large File Handling Strategy
- Streaming uploads with chunked processing
- Tiled inference for very large images
- Progressive loading with lazy evaluation
- Memory-efficient processing pipelines

### Model Versioning and Deployment
- Automated model registry in PostgreSQL
- Docker-based model serving containers
- A/B testing capabilities for model comparison
- Real-time performance monitoring

### Real-time Annotation Workflows
- WebSocket connections for collaborative annotation
- Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution
- Canvas-based annotation interfaces
- Real-time model prediction overlay

### Performance Optimization
- GPU memory management for multiple models
- Model quantization and TensorRT optimization
- Batch processing for inference efficiency
- Caching strategies for repeated computations

## Conclusion

This tech stack provides a robust foundation for an ML evaluation platform with:

- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Celery and Docker
- **Performance**: Optimized inference with FastAPI and modern CV models
- **Flexibility**: PostgreSQL provides both relational and vector database capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript and Next.js provide excellent frontend development
- **Production Readiness**: Docker ensures consistent deployment across environments

The integration of YOLO11/12, RT-DETR, and SAM2 provides state-of-the-art computer vision capabilities, while the async architecture ensures efficient handling of large files and real-time annotation workflows.
