# Authentication

The ML Evaluation Platform API currently supports development without authentication requirements.

## Authentication Methods

### Development Mode

For development and testing purposes, no authentication is required. All endpoints are accessible without any credentials.

### Production Considerations

In a production environment, the following authentication methods would be implemented:

#### API Key Authentication

API keys would be provided for programmatic access:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images"
```

#### Bearer Token Authentication

JWT tokens would be supported for user authentication:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/images"
```

## Security Headers

When authentication is implemented, all requests should include appropriate security headers:

- `X-API-Key`: Your API key
- `Authorization`: Bearer token for JWT authentication
- `Content-Type`: Appropriate content type for the request

## Error Responses

Authentication errors would return:

```json
{
  "error": "Authentication required",
  "message": "Valid API key or bearer token required",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Production deployments would include rate limiting:

- 1000 requests per hour per API key
- 10,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- Burst limits for short-term usage spikes

Rate limit headers would be included in responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when rate limit window resets
